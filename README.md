Project Submission Guide
1. Review Microservices and Configuration
Understanding the Microservices
Notification API: This service is responsible for receiving requests and queuing messages. It uses AWS SQS for message queuing and is deployed using AWS ECS Fargate.

Email Sender: This service processes messages from the SQS queue and sends emails. It is also deployed using AWS ECS Fargate.

Configuration Details
Environment Variables: Ensure that .env files for each microservice are correctly configured with necessary variables such as AWS_REGION, SQS_QUEUE_URL, and any other required configurations.

Service Interaction: The Notification API pushes messages to an SQS queue, and the Email Sender retrieves these messages for processing.

2. Design Deployment Strategy
Deployment Considerations
Scalability: The architecture should handle varying loads. Use AWS ECS with Fargate to ensure that services scale according to demand.

Reliability: Implemented fault-tolerant architecture using multi-AZ deployments and health checks to ensure high availability.

Security: Implemented least-privilege IAM roles, secure communication channels, and store sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.

Architecture Design
Service Mesh: Utilize AWS App Mesh to manage and secure communication between microservices.

Service Discovery: Use AWS Cloud Map to enable microservices to discover each other dynamically.

Monitoring: Implementededed CloudWatch dashboards and alarms to monitor service health and performance.

3. Create Dockerfiles
Dockerfile Structure
Base Image: Use an official Node.js image as the base for both microservices.

Dependencies: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files, and run npm install to install dependencies.

Application Code: Copy the application code into the container.

Expose Ports: Expose the necessary ports (e.g., 3000 for the Notification API).

CMD Instruction: Define the command to start the application.

Testing Docker Images
Local Testing: Build and run the Docker images locally to ensure that the microservices work as expected before pushing to ECR.
4. Push to Amazon ECR
ECR Repository Creation
Create ECR Repositories: Use the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console to create ECR repositories for the Notification API and Email Sender services.
Push Docker Images
Tag Docker Images: Tag the Docker images with the ECR repository URI and the commit SHA for versioning.

Push Images: Push the tagged images to their respective ECR repositories using the AWS CLI.

5. Provision Infrastructure
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Choose a Tool: Terraform

IaC Best Practices:

Ensure modularity by breaking down the infrastructure into reusable modules.
Follow the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle.
Document the code with comments explaining each resource and its purpose.
6. Deploy Services on AWS ECS or Fargate
ECS Service Deployment
Cluster Configuration: Set up an ECS cluster using Fargate for serverless container deployment.

Task Definitions: Define ECS task definitions for both the Notification API and Email Sender services. Include the necessary container settings such as CPU, memory, and network configurations.

Service Configuration: Create ECS services for each microservice, linking them to the appropriate task definitions and load balancers.

AWS App Mesh and Cloud Map Integration
Service Mesh: Configure AWS App Mesh to manage communication between the microservices.

Service Discovery: Use AWS Cloud Map to allow services to discover each other by name within the VPC.

7. Implemented Logging with CloudWatch
CloudWatch Log Groups
Create Log Groups: Create dedicated CloudWatch Log Groups for each service (Notification API and Email Sender).

Log Configuration: Configure the ECS task definitions to send logs to the appropriate CloudWatch Log Groups.

Monitoring Setup
Dashboards: Create CloudWatch dashboards to monitor key metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and SQS queue length.

Alarms: Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify you of critical issues such as high CPU usage or a large number of messages in the SQS queue.

8. Configure Auto-Scaling
Auto-Scaling Policies
CPU-Based Scaling: Implemented auto-scaling based on CPU usage with a 70% threshold. This ensures that the system scales up during high load and scales down when demand decreases.

Terraform Configuration: Use the aws_autoscaling_policy resource in Terraform to define the scaling policies.

9. Configure Health Checks
Health Check Implementation
Endpoints: Ensure that each microservice has a health check endpoint (e.g., /health) that returns a 200 status code if the service is healthy.

ECS Configuration: Configure the ECS service to use this endpoint for health checks.

Load Balancer Integration
Health Check Path: Configure the ALB target group to use the health check path configured in the microservices.
10. Test and Verify
Functional Testing
Service Functionality: Test each microservice individually to ensure that they function as expected.

End-to-End Testing: Perform end-to-end tests to ensure that messages flow correctly from the Notification API to the Email Sender via SQS.
